# Offroad Autonomous Vehicle Vizualization Starter Kit

## About

The Offroad Autonomous Vehicle Vizualization project is utilizing sensor data collected from instrumented
bicycles to create data sets for autonomous vehicles driving on
side-walks, trails, and other non-roadway areas. The project will
develop tools using the Autonomy Visualization System, XVIZ data
format, and sensors, such as the Intel Realsense depth sensor.
